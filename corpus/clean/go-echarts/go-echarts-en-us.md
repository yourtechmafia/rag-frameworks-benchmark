go-echarts
==========

*🎨 The adorable charts library for Golang.*

🔰 Installation
=======================================================

gomod
--------------------------

```
$ go get -u github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts/v2/...
```

OR

```
# go.mod

require github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts/v2
```

classic to get go-echarts
------------------------------------------------------------------

```
# this may be a crude way to use v2 go-echarts without gomod(GO111MODULE=off)

$ go get -u github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts/...
$ cd $go-echarts-project
$ mkdir v2 && mv charts components datasets opts render templates types v2
```

⏳ Version Control
==========================================================

The go-echarts project is being developed under v2 version and the active codebase is on the master branch.

v1 and v2 are incompatible which means that you cannot upgrade go-echarts from v1 to v2 smoothly. But I think it is
worth trying that new version.

Especially, when there contains mino changes (usually in enhancement), we will release the `rc` version before a
standard
release.
So, if you upgrade your projects cross the `rc` versions, maybe
need little adjust.

✨ Features
============================================

* Clean and comprehensive API.
* Visualize your data in 25+ different ways.
* Highly configurable chart options.
* Detailed documentation and a rich collection of examples.
* Visualize your geographical data with 400+ maps.
